1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
The project is well structured and easy to understand.

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
Yes, R was used to data analysis and graphical presentation and Python for data cleaning.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
Yes, It seems to be working fine.

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
The plots looks good. For the plot 2.2 I would add a bit more information waht this graph is present.

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
I would add a bit more description to each part of R code. Just more notes.

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
I would add way more discription to the README file and to the R markdown. For example data source, what the meaning of the data.

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?

I like how you made the conclusions.

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
I think you should add this part. It would be great if you will add the link to UMD and explain wahat they do.

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
Yes. But for fig.2.2 I suggest to add a discription about what each dot means for somebody who doesn't use statistical analysis so often.

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
I would add some short notes to the code in R markdown.

11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?

Project looks very well. If you will add a bit more background information as data source it will look more clear. Good luck!
