1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
I can't see the makefile in your directory. Would be great if your will provide it to the final project.

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
Yes, project use both Python(for data cleaning) and R (for data processing).

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
I was not able to find Docker file.

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
Yes, I very lie the analysis performed.

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
Just add Make and Docker files.

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
I really like how the readme file look like.

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
The purpose looks good for me, but I would add more details for the UMD about why they may need this statistical information. Why it is important to know and how they may use it in the future.

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
Yes, I like all the references you provided.

9. Is the interpretation of figures clearly explained?
Yes.

10. Is the purpose and interpretation of analysis steps clearly communicated?
I very like, how the code was commented.

11. Are overall take-home messages clearly communicated?

I would add a litle bit to the markdown file about the result. What trends do you see and how it would help to UMD.
Good luck!
