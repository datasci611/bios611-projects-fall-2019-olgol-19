Urban Ministries of Durham(UMD) ended homelessness for 248 people in FY 2018-19.

UMD welcome neighbors in need regardless of ethnicity, religious belief or non-belief, sexual orientation or gender identification, or disability. 
The programs end homelessness by providing neighbors with emergency shelter and case management to help them overcome barriers such as unemployment, medical and mental health problems, past criminal convictions and addiction. UMD assist around 6,000 people each year who need food, shelter, clothing and/or supportive services through these main programs:

1. Community Shelter for men, women and families who need a safe emergency place to sleep.

2. Community Cafe serves three meals a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to shelter guests and anyone in Durham who is hungry.

3. Food Pantry and Clothing Closet distribute groceries, clothing and hygiene products to approximately 500 households per month to help those with extremely limited means to make ends meet.


# Project goal

I want to help UMD better understand their new clients. I will select only the informayion about the people who entered the program and analyze demographical information.

I hope this will help UMD to create new specific programs for some of the groups under the risk of homelless.
