# Data Source

Data was provided by Urban Ministries of Durham.

Urban Ministries of Durham operates the Food Pantry and Clothing Closet and Community Cafe to address basic emergency needs for food, clothing, diapers and hygiene supplies.

# Problem

The data from the Project 1 is usufull but somewhat difficult to understand to anyone who have never used the scientific reports before.
I need to present the data to the customer in more clear and interactive way to give the opportunity to explore the data.

# What need to be done?

1. Allow user to select the data range for report.
2. Give the options to choose between different result plots.
